# The Programming Course

This course introduces programming, starting with Dart and Flutter, then moving to JavaScript and Node.js.

Our learning approach emphasizes the practical side of programming while still covering the essential theory.
Why this approach?

In the AI era, practical skills matter more than memorizing theory. Tools can assist with theory, but you must understand what you are building.
We will teach the key concepts so you not only build things well but also understand how and why they work.
